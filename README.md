# GWT-4-distribution
O4a CBC population distributions (GWTC-4.0)

Scripts to generate the O4a CBC masses and spins distribution using the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) 4.0, updated after the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) of advanced ground-based interferometers (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA).

- Extracts posterior samples of masses (`mass1`, `mass2`) and spins (`spin1z`, `spin2z`) from GWTC-4.0.
- Enables generation of synthetic O4a populations based on observed CBC properties.
- CBC events include BBH, BNS, and NSBH subpopulations.
- Population model from [does-matter-matter-o3b](http://git.ligo.org/amanda.farah/does-matter-matter-o3b).
